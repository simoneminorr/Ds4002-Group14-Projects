FedEx,"February 4, 2026",1,"Low-level service. Not recommended to order or let them handle your shipment. No one there knows how to provide clear answers or proper explanations without creating even more questions. They charge unreasonable fees and amounts without actually explaining what the payment is for. The payment process feels unsafe, and the shipment is not organized. They demand additional charges without prior notice or informing the customer. On top of that, the delivery itself is completely unorganized. The courier calls whenever he feels like it, without scheduling in advance, even though the customer is available and ready to pay. Without extra payment, the package is not delivered, and rescheduling the delivery becomes a huge and exhausting procedure. I will never order from or deal with FedEx again, and I strongly recommend everyone to stay away from them as a shipping company.",Trustpilot – FedEx (www.fedex.com)

Package has had status out for delivery for more than 2 days and the customer service phone number routes you to just telling you it's out for delivery and that's all the information they have and hang up on you. The only way to get a real person is to say ""something else"", ""tech support"", ""something else"" and then that person will just tell you the same thing.

FedEx,"Januaryy 22,2026",1,"Don't ship with FEDEX
Don't ship with FEDEX - the post office is more reliable. My international package was to be delivered in 4 days. I shipped the Monday, from Bronx, New York to Kingston, Jamaica. It spent 49 hours in Miami - unacceptable. It reached Jamaica on Friday evening. The delivery date was updated on the website from Thursday, January 29th to Monday, February 2. The package spent another day at a local FEDEX shipment centre which was less than 2 miles away from the shipment centre where I had shipped with instructions for it to be held there for the receiver to pick up. When I noticed that the package was not moving, I called to ask FEDEX if the package could be held at the location where it was stuck - and they said they could not guarantee that. To my dismay, they updated the delivery date again to the Wednesday. The telephone number of my recipient was on the package - no one thought to call. Why would they try to hold my package for an additional 2 days when it was less than 2 miles away from their own FEDEX centre where it was to be collected? I asked the recipient to present himself to the location with his ID, and that is how the package was received. The package could have been collected a day earlier if only FEDEX representatives were caring. I kept telling them the distance between where the package was and the destination address (which they should have known because both are FEDEX facilities). The recipient could have collected the package at least a day earlier. FEDEX did not care.

I now am trying to file a claim to get back at least a part of my money; however, FEDEX requires that I open an account with them and provide my banking details. I do not want to put my banking information out there. After all that transpired, I do not trust FEDEX. This requirement to file a claim by requesting your banking information seems to be a way of deterring customers from filing claim. I can't imagine many people wanting to provide their banking information given the circumstances. This is definitely a calculated decision on FEDEX' part to do this to dissuade customers from going through the process. Why is my banking information needed to file a claim? All that is necessary should be my name, address, tracking number, details of what transpired - which FEDEX has access to. It is all there on their website, FEDEX should mail me a check for the inconvenience and unprofessional service they provided. My package took more than twice the amount of time promised to be delivered - instead of 4 days, it took 9 days. Had I not intervened, the package would have taken 11 days to reach the recipient. Surely, the post office would have delivered sooner. I should not have to pay for express delivery for this slow service.

FedEx,3-Feb-26,1,"Delayed Package/Rude Customer Service
I had ordered my item on January 26, 2026 on Wayfair. It is understandable that inclement weather had created a delay with the shipping. However, it is now February 3, 2026. When I follow-up on the tracking with Fed Ex, the website would provide me with misinformation. Fed Ex would mention a delivery on the day of me checking the tracking. Subsequently, it would then inform me that the packages would be delivered the next day. At this point, I’ve been experiencing this delay for close to - if not - over a week. I can recount calling Fed Ex. Due to my back issues, I had called Fed Ex to request that they deliver the package directly to my apartment- with the assistance of the leasing consultants to bring the packages inside my unit or at the front door. One agent just reiterated the tracking like a robot, and before I could speak, she transferred me to the automated review line. I called again, as the male agent started with his scripted speaking points for my information, I had interjected to make him aware for the purpose of my call, he then immediately transfers me to the automated review line. Upon the third call, the agent was extremely helpful. However, despite requesting packages be delivered to my front door, the Fed Ex delivery driver placed one of my packages in the Luxer Storage Room at my apartment building. That particular package was ordered after the aforementioned packages that I am still waiting for delivery. I don’t know what’s going on with Fed Ex, but they have really disappointed me.",Trustpilot – FedEx (www.fedex.com)

I ordered expensive commercial kitchen equipment worth over $1200 that split into 4 shipments. Fed Ex promised that it would be delivered by Carlos.
You can even play pretend with them feeling like you're really tracking your driver's deliveries. It's just the same game with them.
Fed Ex pretends that is going to ship on a stated date, then gives you a time in the afternoon. Then it pushed it up 3 hours earlier. I track it on the app and see that it's in my neighborhood... Says it will be to me by 1:30.
Then suddenly the truck disappears off my map and says it will be delivered by the end of business.
They've pulled this trick with me so many times that I'm done with them.

UPS,6-Feb-26,1,"The Unnecessary UPS Struggle
I will not speak to specific employees because each interaction that I have had with a human face-to-face has been pleasant...

I ordered some stuff online back in December. It was supposed to be delivered by the first week in January. I requested that it be held at one of the UPS ""Access Points"" since 1) it needed a signature and 2) I do not work at home. After paying the $5.99 fee to change the delivery location, the app said for MULTIPLE days that it would be delivered to that Access Point and on each day, the app updated to say that the store was closed. Each time, I would call the store and verify that they were and had been opened. The package ended up ""damaged"" and was sent back to the sender.

The package was resent and expedited since the sender knew that I had BEEN expecting it. I received a delivery window of 1:30 - 3:30 PM. There were no updates whatsoever...at 1:06 PM I get a notification from my doorbell/camera and see the UPS delivery person standing at my door ringing the doorbell. Moments later, another notification stating that they are unable to deliver the package...

UPS's system is extremely ineffective, dishonest, flawed, and manipulative. When I spoke to an agent about paying money to have the package rerouted, she would not agree to refund the money paid for services that were not followed through on. If I could avoid UPS, I would. Their customer service is all over the place and everyone seems to have either no idea or a different idea of what is going on with their company. They can't seem to deliver packages within the appropriate delivery window so that their customers don't have to go through the hassle of stressing about their items...just a horribly ran company through and through.

Each time, UPS updates the system saying the driver was “unable to pick up,” even though no one came. The pickup location is on a main road and easily accessible, not a remote area. It honestly feels like the pickup is being avoided because there are seven boxes.

I called customer service around 10 times. Every time I was told the issue was “escalated,” but nothing changed. If UPS cannot handle multi-box pickups, they should not allow customers to schedule them online.
