FedEx,2026-02-04,1,"Low-level service. Not recommended to order or let them handle your shipment. No one there knows how to provide clear answers or proper explanations without creating even more questions. They charge unreasonable fees and amounts without actually explaining what the payment is for. The payment process feels unsafe, and the shipment is not organized. They demand additional charges without prior notice or informing the customer. On top of that, the delivery itself is completely unorganized. The courier calls whenever he feels like it, without scheduling in advance, even though the customer is available and ready to pay.

FedEx,2026-02-03,1,"Delayed Package/Rude Customer Service
I had ordered my item on January 26, 2026 on Wayfair. It is understandable that inclement weather had created a delay with the shipping. However, it is now February 3, 2026. When I follow-up on the tracking with Fed Ex, the website would provide me with misinformation. Fed Ex would mention a delivery on the day of me checking the tracking. Subsequently, it would then inform me that the packages would be delivered the next day. At this point, Ive been experiencing this delay for close to - if not - over a week. I can recount calling Fed Ex. Due to my back issues, I had called Fed Ex to request that they deliver the package directly to my apartment- with the assistance of the leasing consultants to bring the packages inside my unit or at the front door. One agent just reiterated the tracking like a robot, and before I could speak, she transferred me to the automated review line. I called again, as the male agent started with his scripted speaking points for my information, I had interjected to make him aware for the purpose of my call, he then immediately transfers me to the automated review line. Upon the third call, the agent was extremely helpful. However, despite requesting packages be delivered to my front door, the Fed Ex delivery driver placed one of my packages in the Luxer Storage Room at my apartment building. That particular package was ordered after the aforementioned packages that I am still waiting for delivery.

UPS,2026-02-06,1,"The Unnecessary UPS Struggle
I will not speak to specific employees because each interaction that I have had with a human face-to-face has been pleasant...

I ordered some stuff online back in December. It was supposed to be delivered by the first week in January. I requested that it be held at one of the UPS ""Access Points"" since 1) it needed a signature and 2) I do not work at home. After paying the $5.99 fee to change the delivery location, the app said for MULTIPLE days that it would be delivered to that Access Point and on each day, the app updated to say that the store was closed. Each time, I would call the store and verify that they were and had been opened. The package ended up ""damaged"" and was sent back to the sender.

The package was resent and expedited since the sender knew that I had BEEN expecting it. I received a delivery window of 1:30 - 3:30 PM. There were no updates whatsoever...at 1:06 PM I get a notification from my doorbell/camera and see the UPS delivery person standing at my door ringing the doorbell. Moments later, another notification stating that they are unable to deliver the package...

UPS's system is extremely ineffective, dishonest, flawed, and manipulative. When I spoke to an agent about paying money to have the package rerouted, she would not agree to refund the money paid for services that were not followed through on. If I could avoid UPS, I would. Their customer service is all over the place and everyone seems to have either no idea or a different idea of what is going on with their company. They can't seem to deliver packages within the appropriate delivery window so that their customers don't have to go through the hassle of stressing about their items...just a horribly ran company through and through.
