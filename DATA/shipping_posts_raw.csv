USPS,1r4s4vu,1771093963.0,What is the actual process behind the scenes before a job gets posted,"I'm in a fairly small office, under 20 routes and 175 man work years or whatever.

So, my question is, what is the process in getting it posted? Could the postmaster have already sent a request or whatever, and it's taken 45+ days with no results? Or could they be dragging their feet requesting the role for some job politics reason? 

I haven't been here long, so don't know them will enough yet to know how open they are being. Some bosses will explain the hold up in detail, some will lie, some tell you to feck off.

USPS,1r47gpo,1771032862.0,USPS Job prospects ?,"I live in a metropolitan area and my partner, who has struggled on and off with addiction and is sober !!!, wants to work at the postal office. He’s done a lot of types of work and has been able to remain in his jobs for a long period of time (7 years at his last job doing maintenance and back end stuff at a hotel). 

He likes the idea of being a postal carrier, outside, meeting people, delivering mail — just doing an honest job. Life has been hard for him but he’s just about the most good human being in the world. I want this to work for him. 

So there are positions open near us — we live near the state line between two states that share the same city name (and no one who visits ever seems to know which state they’re actually in). Also, we’ve won the Super Bowl twice in the last 5 years. Hint hint to where we are. 

What am I looking for — I’ve been perusing the thread and I’m more confused than ever. I’m a social worker for the last 20ish years (it’s all I’ve ever done / wanted to do) so I’m trying to help figure out this with him as much as possible. 

So yeah, USPS: there are some jobs that get more hours? Some that get less? Are there any positions that get guaranteed hours? I saw carrier jobs in our area are less than $20/hr but the inside USPS office customer service reps are closer to $22? 

Are these (or any USPS jobs) career type jobs? Do you get promoted often? Raises? I’ve mostly been a medical social worker working for hospitals or insurances etc — salary work &amp; good benefits (tho not federal benefits ; a bit confused about that too).

Honestly, as much as you can tell me to help advise him would be awesome. He’s recently sober because life hasn’t been easy for him. On top of that shitty trauma, he’s got non-diagnosed ADHD, maybe some autistic traits (or could just be his significant anxiety which often overwhelms his whole day). 

We’re working on getting those things taken care of for him without his usual crutch of medicating with alcohol so hopefully those things will be less of an issue when he actually gets to the applying / starting work part but just … anything I can learn would make things easier. 

OH, one of the states we live in / work in has legalized marijuana, the other hasn’t. He is on it medicinally, obviously, in the state where it’s legal. What did drug testing look like? Does it matter if the state you work / live in legalized? 

He has his GED, and like I said, he’s worked all of his life. \*\*I just want him to be happy.\*\* He deserves it — he makes the whole world better when he’s around. I appreciate you for reading all this, if you got this far. Any info helps — thank you in advance!

What am I looking for — I’ve been perusing the thread and I’m more confused than ever. I’m a social worker for the last 20ish years (it’s all I’ve ever done / wanted to do) so I’m trying to help figure out this with him as much as possible. 

So yeah, USPS: there are some jobs that get more hours? Some that get less? Are there any positions that get guaranteed hours? I saw carrier jobs in our area are less than $20/hr but the inside USPS office customer service reps are closer to $22? 

Are these (or any USPS jobs) career type jobs? Do you get promoted often? Raises? I’ve mostly been a medical social worker working for hospitals or insurances etc — salary work &amp; good benefits (tho not federal benefits ; a bit confused about that too).

Honestly, as much as you can tell me to help advise him would be awesome. He’s recently sober because life hasn’t been easy for him. On top of that shitty trauma, he’s got non-diagnosed ADHD, maybe some autistic traits (or could just be his significant anxiety which often overwhelms his whole day). 

We’re working on getting those things taken care of for him without his usual crutch of medicating with alcohol so hopefully those things will be less of an issue when he actually gets to the applying / starting work part but just … anything I can learn would make things easier. 

OH, one of the states we live in / work in has legalized marijuana, the other hasn’t. He is on it medicinally, obviously, in the state where it’s legal. What did drug testing look like? Does it matter if the state you work / live in legalized? 

He has his GED, and like I said, he’s worked all of his life. \*\*I just want him to be happy.\*\* He deserves it — he makes the whole world better when he’s around. I appreciate you for reading all this, if you got this far. Any info helps — thank you in advance!"

USPS,1r43rtu,1771023115.0,is it possible to request being sent to closer offices/not be scheduled far away?,"RCA still within 90 days. I’ve just received my schedule for next week: my usual work day for the route I sub for, two days in another office I’ve been to multiple times, and two other days in an office I’ve never been to that’s an hour away (according to Google maps). 

I don’t mind helping out at other offices, even if it makes me a bit nervous since I’m still newer and all, and still pretty slow most of the time. But the other offices I’ve been to have been close by, maybe a half hour at most until now. This isn’t even counting potential traffic delays because of the awful snowy weather, and how terrible my little car is in it. 

I know there’s a certain amount of miles they can send us out to for other offices I think? This is nearly 40 miles away. 

But I didn’t know if there was a way to request that I not be sent to offices that far away? I’m assuming I definitely have to go these two days since I’m scheduled and can’t be scheduled somewhere closer instead on those days, but is there a way to request that I not be sent out so far? Or no since I’m still within my 90? 

I feel like I kind of screwed myself over since they had asked me to come in to that far away office randomly one day last week and I agreed thinking it would be a one off (not knowing how far away it is), until I remembered I had an appointment scheduled and had to rescind my agreement😭 but now I feel like it just seems they think I’d be okay doing it multiple times a week in the future, or that if I ask not to be scheduled there it’ll look like I lied the other day because of how far away it is. 

I don’t wanna make trouble since I like this job (and need it) but I also don’t want to be scheduled out that far away (on the regular)…

Eventually, it went out for delivery in two different states on the same day, within an hour of each other. One state was correct, the other wasn’t. The package ended up marked as delivered in the wrong state, and the correct state never updated.

UPS,1r46zs4,1771031553.0,UPS Stealing Packages. This is a felony.,"Good day to you all. I tend to avoid Reddit, but today I need to spread some valuable information regarding UPS, the postal carrier that this subreddit revolves around.

They have stolen my package or are willfully withholding it without legal grounds to do so.

I ordered a new Virtual Reality headset. I got a wonderful deal on this $500+ Dollar item. The Seller can confirm that they sent it. The UPS cannot confirm that it arrived, in fact, when they tried to confirm my package arrived I received this image.

[Does this look like a Meta Quest 3 512 GB VR headset with two controllers in the original packaging?](https://preview.redd.it/ufbm8v6k0djg1.png?width=345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f75d739d3b998ecbfd83bf1593ffd206ee5be42b)

Obviously because I expect this to be a trustworthy company, I decided to open an investigation. Only to be told they confirmed with the above information, clearly showing a house that I do not, and have never lived in, with a package that I did not and have never received.

My best assumption is aukums razor; being that they stole the package and are willfully keeping it. Which is a felony across the entire united states as well as under my state law.

I've obviously filed a charge back on my card, I can prove I never received the item, and they've already sent me half the evidence I need by just claiming it arrived. So, I'm going to be just fine and someone will be in possession of stolen mail, if the entire group who partook in this scheme of package theft isn't convicted.

I'm now unable to justify using the UPS under any circumstance and will have to personally warn people to avoid it, which is quite tragic because I know men and women who work at the UPS and enjoy sending packages through them. They're a delight to work with and very kind people. However, I have an item to send soon and I cannot now justify sending it through them, it is a valuable electronic, and I believe in my heart of hearts that they WILL steal it. The money I saved buying this electronic item was within the realm of thousands. A deal that will not come again in a very long time to say the least. Similarly, the deal I got on this item which they stole was spectacular, and I cannot reclaim what I saved with that deal, instead, I have to regretfully and solemnly buy another headset for an inferior deal, taking business away from a seller who did their best to do something good for a person in need, and the money they are owed for an item I, the customer, never received.

I'll be doing my best to report the UPS for this theft. I hope you all have a wonderful day and I hope this comes into the right hands before it is too late, and another innocent person has hundreds of dollars stolen from them because of a corrupt package carrier.

I asked CS earlier and they said the package left the warehouse. What’s happening? I’m done using UPS this is my first and final time.

Edit: so the bullshit CS reps (multiple people) that said that the driver might be late… they’re lying. 2 people from the CS representatives said that the cutoff delivery time is 5:30pm for Sydney and they clock out at that time, so a “late delivery” is not possible. Tired of all this shit. It’s been 11 days and I haven’t received the package, it arrived in the Sydney warehouse earlier this Sunday. What could possibly take them 5 business fucking days to not even deliver it at the end of the week. Ridiculous. And it passed customs on the same day it arrived. 5 fucking BUSINESS days passed and the package is still not here."

FedEx,1r3w9x2,1771005709.0,KYC confusion I need some clarity,"I ordered an item from Alibaba, and due to my oversight, my Alibaba alias was used as the shipping name instead of my actual name. Unfortunately, this happened during the Chinese New Year period, when the supplier’s entire team was on leave.

By the time they resumed work, FedEx had already received the shipment, which meant the supplier could no longer change the name on the AWB. Since this is my first import, it caused a lot of stress and confusion. After numerous conversations with Alibaba customer support and several emails, I finally managed to get the sales manager to provide a name change (amendment) letter along with an updated invoice.

However, the KYC process has not been going smoothly.

After multiple rejections and revisions as requested by the FedEx KYC team, I received a call this morning confirming that the KYC was successful and that the next step would be delivery. I was relieved — but by 7 PM, I received another email stating that the KYC was unsuccessful and that additional documents were required.

I have already replied to that email explaining the situation again and attaching all the requested documents.

At this point, I’m confused about the lack of coordination between teams. My main concern is whether this internal confusion could lead to my package being held or stopped by customs, even though I have submitted all the correct documents.

FedEx,1r3hx3n,1770964282.0,FedEx left my refrigerated medication in a warm parcel room for 64 hours — who is actually at fault here?,"I’m honestly still in disbelief and trying to figure out how this even happened. Also trying to not be so frustrated by this, but it’s hard!

I receive a very expensive medication every eight weeks that must be kept refrigerated. The box is clearly labeled with a big yellow sticker that says exactly that. I also must sign for it and show ID when it’s delivered.

On Tuesday morning, FedEx attempted delivery while I was at work. This happens often. Normally, they leave a slip and I pick it up at the local FedEx facility later that day.

That’s exactly what they appeared to do this time.

The door slip told me to wait until after 6pm Tuesday to pick it up, and gave me the address of the FedEx facility. I wasn’t able to go Tuesday evening, and I was busy yesterday and this morning, so I finally went today (Thursday).

The FedEx employee told me:

“It’s not here. Your concierge signed for it.”

That was… alarming.

So I drove straight home and checked with my building concierge. And yes — they did sign for it. Then they placed it in our parcel room.

Which is not refrigerated.

That box sat there for about 64 hours.

By the time I found it, it was no longer cold. I immediately contacted a random pharmacist (the special pharmacy I deal with for this med was closed already) and was told not to take the medication because it’s no longer safe.

So now I’m left with a ruined, expensive medication ($5,000 CAD) — and a lot of confusion.

What I don’t understand:

\- Why did FedEx leave me a pickup slip if they were going to hand it to the concierge?

\- Why would they release a signature-required, temperature-sensitive medical package to someone who isn’t me?

\- And why didn’t the concierge read the very obvious label that says “REFRIGERATE IMMEDIATELY”????

I tried calling FedEx, but they just told me to file a claim online. I’m hesitant because I feel like those go into a black hole.

I’m calling my pharmacy tomorrow and I’m sure we’ll figure something out — but I’m genuinely wondering:

Who is at fault here? FedEx? My building? Both?

And is this worth filing a claim over?

Has anyone dealt with something like this before?

Do you see the label 4x6 on the POD? It's 4x6, how TF is that box 33x17x11?

FedEx,1r35osl,1770930866.0,What is the point of notifications . . .,". . . and whose fault is it that they mean nothing?

This week, I have been notified that my package is on a truck, out for delivery and the estimate is that it will be delivered by X time, and that my signature is required *4 times.*

The number of times *that same package has been delivered, AT ALL* is zero. 

1st day. I figured as we had had snow that week, even though *another FedEx package (that didn't require a signature) WAS DELIVERED* it was probably just them catching up. I was annoyed but not really mad. 

2nd day, I stayed home again to be sure I wouldn't miss them. Estimated time passes and *then* they change the status to be delivered by end of day. When that passes, I call customer service and am told it was a weather delay. I ask, ""a weather delay when it was on a truck to be delivered and the roads are driveable? They tell me it will be delivered ""tomorrow."" 

3rd Day *EXACTLY THE SAME THING HAPPENS.* I call again and am told they have escalated and have ""contacted the station."" The representative tells me to just trust that they have notated it. 

4th Day (today) the estimated time of arrival has once again come and gone.

I ordered a package last week with expedited 2-4 day shipping. It began shipping on time on the 9th, with an original delivery date of the 11th. The morning of the 10th it still said it would be delivered the next day. That night it then updated to say the delivery will be on 11th. On the morning of the 11th, with the package now at my local fedex facility, it still said it would be delivered. Sure enough that afternoon it updated to the 12th. I woke up this morning to it now saying its going to be delivered on the 13th and the package is BACK in TN customs.

Im assuming someone messed up the customs scans first time it was in TN? Has anyone had this happen to them previously?

Fedex customer support was less than helpful, and said they still dont have the package yet (said they NEVER had it in possession  
??), and dont know why the tracking says it was in Chicago or Carey (The first person I spoke with said she couldnt see it ever being in IL, the second said he saw it but doesn't know how its possible) They cant offer anything other than a ""sorry you just have to wait.""

Normally I would just let my mild annoyance go, but this is a high value item I paid expedited shipping for, and Id like to get better answers and service compared to, ""I dont know, thats weird, sorry. We dont have it yet."" I also tried filing a claim for the shipping cost but their claim system is down, and was told to reach out to the shipper. (I will, but itll take a few days to get in contact with the company which adds to the frustration)

Even if a simple processing mistake, things like this have been happening for YEARS without any actual changes. Is there no way to actually hold FedEx accountable for their subpar systems and service?

**EDIT: Package was suddenly successfully delivered by FedEx roughly 3 hours after posting this post and contacting customer support on 2/12/26. No update was made to tracking prior to sudden delivery. Still never got clarity on why the tracking info and information I was told from two separate customer support reps was so incorrect and inconsistent.

FedEx,1r30e2q,1770919030.0,FedEx Office employee mad that I’m not supposed to use self-service kiosk,"So my company occasionally does time-sensitive FedEx shipments. Our policy, if we’re shipping something during business hours, is to go to FedEx and have it scanned \*at the counter\*. This is for a couple reasons:  

1) The self-service kiosk system is not integrated with the broader tracking system. So the scan you do at the kiosk doesn’t really record anything and will not be reflected in the tracking. For us, this defeats the whole purpose of going to the FedEx Office store. We need immediate proof that FedEx is in possession of the shipment.  

2) We have had instances where the kiosk box is not picked up until the following day even when we drop the package before the cutoff time. And because there’s no origin scan, we have no recourse. The shipment is just delayed and we’re not refunded.

Every time I’ve gone to the counter with a prepaid shipment asking for a scan and receipt, the employee is friendly and the whole transaction takes 10 seconds. That was until the other day, when the employee took my package, walked out from behind the counter, and tried to use the kiosk for my drop off until I stopped her and told her that I needed a scan \*at the counter\* that will actually reflect on the tracking.

Finally she relented and scanned it at the counter, which again, would have been done in 10 seconds rather than whole ordeal she created.

I don't know what else to do. We're gathering documents now to report to BBB, but is there anyone else that we can ask for, copy, call, etc.? So we may actually get help? I don't know how this company stays in business."

dhl,1r3vwpl,1771004903.0,Valentines gift in custom😢,"Hey!  I could really use some advice. 

I shipped a small Valentines gift 🎁💖on February 5th from the Netherlands to Oslo, but it has unfortunately been held up at customs. The recipient has received a notification asking  for more information. I called customer service in the Netherlands and they need either a D-nummer or a Norwegian social security number. However, the person is an exchange student and doesn’t have either one.

To make things more confusing, the customs instructions haven’t been very clear. We’re wondering:
Would a Dutch ID be sufficient to release the package?
Is there any way for exchange students to clear such packages without a D-number?
Or is there a form or procedure we’re missing?

At this point, the surprise part of the gift is kind of ruined,😣 but I’m hoping it’s not lost completely.

Any help or advice from others who’ve had similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Scotland: Ordered 2 separate parcels from the same company on the 3rd of February to be delivered from England to Scotland. Paid £14 for 48 hour shipping. Was told they would land on the 6th, then the 7th, then the 11th. Nothing. Trying to actually find out what’s going on is a nightmare. There contact page is just a bot who says “delayed“. The link on the DHL contact page to make a complaint does not take you to any page to make a complaint. I managed to find a number for DHL on Reddit and got through to a guy who hung up on me. Phoned back spoke to someone who says my parcel hasn’t even been scanned into the English depot. So two seperate parcels go missing from same company. kinda indicates a rogue courier. There is absolutely no way to make a complaint. I’m sure dhl are breaching UK laws. There twitter account responded to me to tell me they can’t help me as my parcel is with Dhlecommerce and not them.
