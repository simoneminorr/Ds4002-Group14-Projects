Once you’re out of the office you’re on your own

Cons:
You’re “own your own” for much of it really haha

Jokes aside, management is the major con. From micromanaging, to downright harassment and belittlement. Fortunately that widely varies depending on the station and region.

The next big one is the obvious: elements. Try to visit as many stations as possible and get as many donated uniform pieces as you can collect. Anything near your size. Also check with your union hall as soon as you have orientation and a badge

Third is everything you have to memorize. From the routes themselves, to the case, to the pkgs in your satchel, to the vacation holds, endorsements and procedures. First priority is obstructions and park points

Outside of that, it’s the hardest easy job to learn. Once you learn it (give or take a year), you damn near operate on autopilot. You’re left alone for most of the day. Can listen to music or podcasts or audiobooks. Get to be out in the world, never standing in one place for long. Use your hands and get to serve your community.

Just remember above all else: get to know your union reps, the contract and the idiom: it takes what it takes. Don’t rush. Focus on accuracy before efficiency. It all comes with time

USPS,USPS,1r47gpo,o5a7zze,1771040330.0,"To answers your question: Yes, there are some job positions that receive more or less hours, however, that is mostly dependent on the needs of the office itself, or if you are career vs non-career. Most positions if you start as a carrier (city or rural) or clerk, you are able to be loaned out in order to receive more hours. However, you don’t necessarily have a say in which offices you work at and you can be sent out as far as 50 miles. 

Generally speaking for entry level positions, really only full-time or non-traditional full-time regulars (clerks), regular rural or city carriers or custodians receive guaranteed hours. There are different positions that are guaranteed a certain amount of hours per pay period or every time they work, such as PTF (part-time flex) employees. RCA’s, ARCs and CCAs starting hourly wage is less than that of a PSE, however, due to potential overtime they could make more money.

If you go onto the legacy website, which is the old USPS website, you will be able to find out which specific job postings are career or not. It will say something such as “city carrier CAREER WITH BENEFITS” and states in the description that it is a career position. Most of those career positions are PTF positions vs a regular career position. You can determine which is which because regular career will list the salary vs PTF will list the hourly wage.

You don’t necessarily get promoted in the traditional sense, instead you convert from non-career into career, or convert from PTF to full-time. If you want to go into a higher level position, such as management or supervisor, you do have to apply to those positions and get accepted. You do technically receive “raises” that are in the form of step increases and in the form of COLAs (cost of living adjustments). The post office does offer decent enough benefits/insurance plans for non-career employees, but obviously career employees have the better insurance and retirement plans and years of service actually counts towards your retirement when you become career. 

The post office does not drug test.

The fact is that my neighbor (whose veracity I trust far more than any crap-brown-uniformed UPS delivery driver) saw a UPS truck sitting for several minutes down the street at the precise time that I received a 1:53pm timestamped email stating that delivery had been attempted. The delivery was supposed to occur between 11am-1pm. The email was timestamped 1:53pm. There was no delivery attempt. I was on the phone with UPS customer support and I informed the individual in UPS Security and District Management that I had gotten the failed delivery attempt notification WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE. Also, as I've noted, I've got security cameras covering my property, and that delivery driver was parked out of range of those. So that dude lied about ever attempting delivery.",True,False,True

""Warehouse scans"" indicate the package is in a UPS facility, likely stuck in a backlog. Since documents are provided, you should still receive the package, though it may take 1-4 weeks.

* **Customs Backlog:** The package is in a government-controlled area, and UPS has no authority to speed up the process, regardless of having the documents.
* **Warehouse Scans Loop:** The package may be stuck in an ""import scan"" loop because of a backlog, often taking weeks to clear, especially when coming from outside the EU.
* **Inaccurate Tracking:** The UPS app might not reflect real-time movement, making it seem stalled when it is merely sitting in a container waiting for clearance.

**What to do next:**

* **Be Patient:** While frustrating, 3-4 weeks is currently considered normal for international shipments in customs.
* **File a Claim/Investigation:** If it hasn't moved in over 7-10 days, initiate a formal investigation (lost package claim) through the [UPS website](https://www.ups.com/us/en/support/tracking-support/where-is-my-package/understanding-tracking-status).

* **Wait for Local Brokerage:** If additional taxes (VAT/Duties) are required, UPS will contact you for payment, which is usually the last step before release.

Since you already sent the SSN by SMS and want to submit a photo or re-do it properly, only do that through an official secure DHL upload link or the “authenticate yourself” flow shown on the tracking page, and if you no longer have the link, use [DHL Customer Service](https://www.dhl.com/us-en/home/customer-service.html) to ask for the identity/SSN upload link to be re-sent (avoid replying with SSN images by regular text or email). Also, because this is moving as DHL Express (not Japan Post delivery), if this was bought from a seller, having the shipper contact DHL to provide the needed importer details often gets the clearance request resolved faster than the receiver waiting for a callback.
